          Yoga connects body, mind and soul. It helps not only in achieving good
          health but also in gaining inner peace and becoming self-aware. We
          YogaTeam, NIT Kurukshetra are one of the torch bearers of this ancient
          culture. We conduct regular yoga sessions and work towards inculcating
          its habit in the students. We perform on various occasions, like
          national festivals and International Yoga Day. We showcase our
          competence in tournaments like INTER-NIT and ITUSA. Our team is
          dedicated to promoting the practice and benefits of yoga within our
          college community and beyond. Led by our mentor, Mrs Rita Saini, we
          strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where anyone
          can explore and deepen their yoga practice. Our team is made up of
          passionate yoga enthusiasts who come from a variety of backgrounds and
          skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned yogi or just starting out, we
          invite you to join us for our regular yoga classes, workshops, and
          events.<br/>
           At the Yog Team, we believe that yoga is not just a physical
          practice, but also a way to cultivate mindfulness, self-awareness, and
          compassion. Our classes focus on creating a safe space where students
          can connect with their breath, quiet their minds, and tap into their
          inner strength and wisdom. In addition to our regular classes, we also
          offer specialized workshops and events throughout the year. These may
          include guest teacher workshops, retreats, community service projects,
          and more. We're always exploring new ways to bring the benefits of
          yoga to our community. We invite you to explore our website to learn
          more about our team, our mentor, and our offerings. If you have any
          questions or would like to join us for a class, please don't hesitate
          to reach out. We look forward to seeing you on the mat!
